Icarus is a dynamically typed language that has the following features.

**Supported data types:**<br>
Booleans (true, false)<br>
Numbers (integers and decimals)<br>
Strings ("some string here")<br>
nil (the equivalent of null in Java or nullptr in c++)<br>

**Supported operators and their representation:**<br>
Addition (number1 + number2)<br>
Subtraction (number1 - number2)<br>
Multiplication (number1 * number2)<br>
Division (number1 / number2)<br>
Negation (-number)<br>

**Less than (number1 < number2)**<br>
Less than or equal (number1 <= number2)<br>
Greater than (number1 > number2)<br>
Greater than or equal (number1 >= number2)<br>
Equal (number1 == number2)<br>
Not equal (number1 != number2) <br>

not (!some_boolean) <br>
and (boolean1 and boolean2) <br>
or (boolean1 or boolean2) <br>

Grouping using brackets (eg. (2 + 2 + 2)/3 = 2)


**Statements:**<br>
print statements<br>

        print "a string";
        print 1;

Note how statements have to end with semicolons

For grouping statements together, use a block

        {
            print "statement1";
            print "statement2";
        }
