Icarus is a dynamically typed language that has the following features.

Supported data types:
Booleans (true, false)
Numbers (integers and decimals)
Strings ("some string here")
nil (the equivalent of null in Java or nullptr in c++)

Supported operators and their representation:
Addition (number1 + number2)
Subtraction (number1 - number2)
Multiplication (number1 * number2)
Division (number1 / number2)
Negation (-number)

Less than (number1 < number2)
Less than or equal (number1 <= number2)
Greater than (number1 > number2)
Greater than or equal (number1 >= number2)
Equal (number1 == number2)
Not equal (number1 != number2)

not (!some_boolean)
and (boolean1 and boolean2)
or (boolean1 or boolean2)

Grouping using brackets (eg. (2 + 2 + 2)/3 = 2)


Statements:
print statements

print "a string";
print 1;

Note how statements have to end with semicolons

For grouping statements together, use a block

{
    print "statement1";

    print "statement2";
}
