Set up


19 May 2024:
Added tokens (numbers, letters, operators like less than, equal etc.) Currently
working on how to parse different tokens.

20 May 2024:
Finished parsing tokens (see scanner.cpp and scanner.h). Now working on parsing
expressions. Think of expressions as a group of tokens. Expression classes are
being written using metaprogramming (see generateast.cpp) in tools folder.
